CH 2 ADDING BEHAVIOR

- The value for the android:text in the TextView refers to a String resource in string.xml.

- Attribute values are always in quotes (ex. android:visbility = "invisible").


- developer.android.com/reference = Android reference


----------onClick----------


android:onClick is an attribute on the Button View

- android: onClick = "onLoveButtonClick" ('onLoveButtonClicked' is a method)


- setContentView(R.layout.main) - This code is setting the view in main.xml on the screen. 



public void onLoveButtonClicked (View view)

-onLoveButtonClicked' method name needs to match the value of the android:onClick attribute. 

- 'View' method needs to take one argument of a View. This is the view that was clicked. 


- Implementing the action in the 'onLoveButtonClicked' method consists of 2 parts. First, you need to get a reference to the TextView, and then you need to set the 'visibility' to true. 


public void onLoveButtonClicked(View view) {
	TextView haikuTextView = ______;    // Make a variable to reference the haiku TextView.
}



----------'R' file---------

- How to get references to XML defined Views from the Java Code: 'R' file.

- 'R' file constants allow you to get Java references to the TextView you defined in main.xml.


public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	setContentView(R.layout.main);
}




--------findViewById----------

- 'findViewById' method is in the base class of Activity, so you can use it directly in the AndroidLove.java class since it is a subclass of Activity (AndroidLove.java is from an exercise).

- 'findViewById' method takes one parameter, the R constant for the View. 

Example: 

Button button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.Button01);


button = make a reference to store the returned view.
(Button) = Cast the returned View to the appropriate View class you're looking for. 

R.id.Button01 = Pass the R.id.Button01 to findViewById to get a reference to the on-screen button. 




---------The Complete Action Magnets Solution---------

public class AndroidLove extends Activity {
	public void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState){
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.main);
	}


	public void onLoveButtonClicked(View view) {
		TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.haikuTextView);

		textView.setVisbility(View.VISIBLE);    // the TextView visibility is set to true so it displays.
	}
}



---------Making A Button Action----------

- Use the Button onClick attribute to declare the name of the action method. 

- Open the Activity that displays the layout with the Button. 

- Add a method with a name matching the onClick attribute value.

- Make sure the method takes in a single View as a parameter. 



- All the Java source is in the /src folder.
