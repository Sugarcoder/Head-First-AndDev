Ch 9: Store Your Stuff

- How to store your data using a SQLite database
- How to create and manage your own SQLite database 
- How to integrate the SQLite database with your ListView in the TimeTracker app. 

------------------------

- Persist the list data in the SQLite database and display the data from the database, and you'll have 'persistent data storage'.


Storing times in the database: 

1. Create a database for your app.
2. Save a time record. 
3. Load time records.
4. Update the List to use the database. 



----------Start by creating the database----------

- SQLiteOpenHelper() = provides you will all of the basic behavior to manage a database. 

- Create a new class (ex. TimeTrackerOpenHelper) that extends SQLiteOpenHelper. There are 3 methods you'll need to implement that describes how to connect to your database, initially create tables, and upgrade from previous versions. 


Example: 

public static class TimeTrackerOpenHelper extends SQliteOpenHelper {
	
	TimeTrackerOpenHelper(Context context) {
		super(context, "timetracker.db", null, 1);        // pass the name of the database to 'super'
	}


	public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase database) {
		// Create your tables in here
	}


	public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
		handle database schema upgrades in here
	}

}
