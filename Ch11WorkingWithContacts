Ch 11: Working With Device Contacts

- Using the native contact selection screen will keep the same flow, but you won't have to build it yourself. 

- Intents = A generic mechanism for invoking an action that the system can respond to. 

- You don't have to include a reference to an Activity in an Intent. 

- You can find extensive docs for the Uris and Actions you can pass into an Intent in the 'Intent online docs'.


- You need to create an Intent to select a contact from the contact list. 

Example: 

Intent (String action, Uri, uri);


- Uri (Uniform Resource Identifier) = a reference to data/resource on the device, while the Action says what to do with the data. 

- To make the types work with the constructor, you need to convert the string in a Uri object, using 'Uri.parse'.

Example: 

Uri contactUri = Uri.parse("content://com.android.contacts/contacts");



- Use constants when you can. 

- Add the 'READ_CONTACTS' permissinog to AndroidManifest.xml in order to access the contacts. 

Example: 

<user-permission android:name="android/permission.READ_CONTACTS" />



- ContentResolver = a utility class that you can use to query the contacts.
